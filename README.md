## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Frequently asked questions ‚ÑπÔ∏è

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run the workshop on my computer?</strong></summary>

There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
If you do so, you will need
* git installed on your local system
* [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)

You will have to adapt commands and paths based on your environment and install the dependencies by yourself. **We won't provide support** to keep on track with schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to be successful.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What other prerequisites are there?</strong></summary>

* You will need a github account
* You will also need Netlify and Astra DB accounts, but we'll work through that in the exercises
* Use **Chrome** or **Firefox** for the best experience. Other browsers are great, but don't work well with the GitPod integration we use a bit later.

# Part 1 - DB and Workspace Setup

## 1. Login or Register to AstraDB

_**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, 40M read/write operations and about 80GB storage monthly for free - sufficient to run small production workloads. If you use up your credits the databases will pause, no charge, and you will be given the option to upgrade to a higher tier._

[Login to Astra](https://astra.datastax.com)

Your initial database can have any name and keyspace, we will create the workshop database shortly.

## 2. Deploy skeletal GUI to Netlify

‚úÖ **Step 2a: Netlify Button:** Click the following button to deploy the skeletal GUI to Netlify. There is no data since there is no database connected to the app (yet); we will connect the database to the app shortly.

**Note**: preferrably Ctrl-click for a new tab.

<details>
<summary>
What does the Netlify deploy button do?
</summary>

The Netlify deploy button will:

- Create a new repository for you on Github (Note: it's an unrelated _copy_, not a fork)
- Create a site on Netlify (and deploy a nonworking build of the app, which lacks the DB connection parameters still)
- Link the two together.

</details>

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/datastaxdevs/netflix_thatconference)

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify button in action](images/deploy-to-netlify.gif)

</details>

This will take a few minutes:

- you may have to authenticate through Github in the process;
- confirm the repo name and "Save & Deploy" when asked.

_Note: if there is an existing account in Netlify, check the settings to make sure the Netlify account is connected to your Github account._

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Deploy to Netlify, "connected accounts"](images/netlify-connect-01.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 2b: Check the deploy logs:** 

Click on `Site deploy in progress` within the Netlify UI.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Deploy to Netlify, "site deploy in progress"](images/deploy-1.png)

</details>

Then click the top deploy link to see the build process.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Deploy to Netlify, "Production/Building"](images/deploy-2.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 2c: Complete the build:** 

Wait until the build shows `Netlify Build Complete`,  **When you see "_Pushing to repository..._"** you're ready to move on.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Deploy to Netlify, logs showing build finishing](images/deploy-3b.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 2d: Get back to your new site:** 

Scroll up to the top and click on the site name (it'll be after "_[your login]_'s Team" next to the Netlify button). Then locate your app's full URL and click to open it.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Deploy to Netlify, site name next to your team's name](images/deploy-4.png)

</details>

## 3. Launch Gitpod from YOUR Github repo

‚úÖ **Step 3a: Jump to YOUR repo:** 

Click on the `GitHub` in `Deploys from GitHub` to get to your new repository on Github.
Scroll to where you were in the README.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Deploy to Netlify, ](images/deploy-5.png)

</details>

> **Note** At this point, you MUST be reading this README from **YOUR** Github repository.
> That is, if the address bar still says `https://github.com/datastaxdevs/...` please
> head over to YOUR copy of the repo before going the Gitpod route!

‚úÖ **Step 3b: Launch Gitpod:**

Use this link to open Gitpod from **YOUR** repository! (_Tip: Ctrl-click on the button to open in new tab._)

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

_Note: the button works on <img src="images/chrome-logo.svg" height="20"/> Chrome and <img src="images/firefox-logo.svg" height="20"/> Firefox._

<details>
<summary>Click to troubleshoot if you have another browser</summary>

<img src="images/gitpod_trick.png" />

</details>

‚ÑπÔ∏è _It may take a few minutes (approx. 3-5) for GitPod to fully initialize.
Please wait until the console in the lower half of Gitpod is responsive._

> You may see a dialog about "opening this workspace in VS Code Desktop": you can safely dismiss it.

Gitpod will be your IDE from now on. If you are familiar with VSCode, you can probably
just use it. Otherwise, take a moment to review a separate page
["Know your Gitpod"](know_your_gitpod.md)
and then come back here.

## 4. Set up and use `astra-cli`

You are going to use a CLI tool to simplify operations with Astra DB. The tool
is [preinstalled](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-classic/docs/astra-cli/installation.html)
on your Gitpod.

‚úÖ **Step 4a: Create a security token:**

[Create a token for your app](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#c-procedure), _using the **"Database Administrator"** role_.
Keep it handy for later use (best to download it in CSV format, as the values
will not be visible afterward).
This will provide authentication later when interacting with the database.
Today, in particular, you'll need the string labeled "token" (the one starting with `AstraCS:...`).

‚úÖ **Step 4b: Set up the CLI:**

Run the following in the Gitpod terminal and,
when prompted, enter the `AstraCS:...` you obtained in the previous step.

``` bash
astra setup
```

<details>
<summary>
Show me!
</summary>

![astra-cli](images/astra-cli-setup-2.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 4b: Create the workshops database:**

``` bash
astra db create workshops -k netflix --if-not-exists
```

It may take a few minutes for this to complete, once it does you can continue.

# Part 2 - DB Setup and Data Ingest

## 1. Create table for genres with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 1a:** Open **GraphQL Playground**:

0. Ensure you are logged on to your [Astra](https://astra.datastax.com) account
1. Click on the "workshops" database on the left (expanding the list if needed)
2. Click `Connect` TAB
3. Click the `APIs`  connection method
4. Make sure `GraphQL API` is selected
5. Locate the link to your GraphQL Playground in the text

![Open Astra DB GraphQL Playground image](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/raw/master/images/open-playground-2-wh.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here if you are not using the "New Astra Experience" UI (yet)</strong></summary>

![Open Astra DB GraphQL Playground image, old Astra UI](images/open-playground-2.png)

</details>

**Note**: in the following, we will refer to "playground tabs". These are _not_ the tabs
in your browser, rather they are tabs _within_ the Playground application,
to switch between the (logically distinct) realms of "managing schema" and "managing data in the tables"
(more on that later).

![Playground tabs VS Browser tabs](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-graphql-netflix/raw/master/images/tabs-vs-playgroundtabs-labeled-2.png)

‚úÖ  **Step 1b:** Provide the database token as header

In the GraphQL Playground, **Populate HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token (including the `AstraCS:` part).
_This is the "Database Administrator" token you created earlier on the Astra DB dashboard (Step 2 above)._


<details>
<summary>
<strong>Note</strong>: make sure you are on the <strong>graphql-schema</strong> playground tab in this step. Click here to show image.
</summary>

![GraphQL Playground and token header, Schema playground tab](images/graphql-playground.png)

</details>

> Note: the GraphQL Playground starts with a ready-to-use _temporary token_ as the `x-cassandra-token` header. But you want the queries run in the Playground
> to be identical to those that the Netlify functions will run from code, so **please replace the token with your DB token as instructed**.

‚úÖ  **Step 1c:** In GraphQL Playground, create the `reference_list` table:

Copy the following **mutation** to the left panel

```yaml
mutation createReferenceList {
  reference_list: createTable(
    keyspaceName:"netflix",
    tableName:"reference_list",
    ifNotExists:true
    partitionKeys: [ 
      { name: "label", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
    clusteringKeys: [
      { name: "value", type: {basic: TEXT}, order: "ASC" }
    ]
  )
}
```

<details>
<summary>and then use the big "play button" arrow in the center to execute it. Click for screenshot.</summary>

![image](images/playground-1.png)

</details>


**GraphQL Playground troubleshooting** (covers this whole section)

|Trouble| Shooting|
|---|---|
|Server cannot be reached | Add Astra token to headers (including `AstraCS:...`; check quotes) |
|Server cannot be reached (second playground tab) | Check playground target URL ends with `netflix` |
Response not successful: Received status code 401 | Same as "server cannot be reached" |
| Response not successful: Received status code 404 | Check spelling of keyspace in target URL |
|"Play" button does nothing| Ensure query is syntactically correct |
"Validation error of type FieldUndefined" | Most likely query in the wrong playground tab, or writing to table not created yet |

## 2. Insert genre data with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 2a:** Get to the API URL for your keyspace

In graphQL playground, **change playground tab** to now use `graphql`. The Playground has its own address bar
(**note**: it's _not_ the address bar of your browser). Edit the ending of the URL shown there, from `system` to the
name of the keyspace: `netflix`

‚úÖ  **Step 2b:** Repeat the insertion of the `x-cassandra-token` header for this playground tab (as you did for the first one):

<details>
<summary>Show me!</summary>

![image](images/graphql-playground-2.png)

</details>

‚úÖ  **Step 2c:** In the GraphQL Playground, run the mutation that writes genre data:

Copy the following mutation on the left panel:

```yaml
mutation insertGenres {
  action: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Action"}) {
    value{value}
  }
  anime: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Anime"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  award: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Award-Winning"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  children: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Children & Family"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  classic: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Classic"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  comedies: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Comedies"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  crime: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Crime"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  cult: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Cult"}) {
     value{value}
  }  
  documentaries: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Documentaries"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  drama: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Dramas"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  fantasy: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Fantasy"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  french: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"French"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  horror: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Horror"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  independent: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Independent"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  international: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"International"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  italian: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Italian"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  musicmusicals: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Music & Musicals"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  realitytv: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Reality TV"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  romance: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Romance"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  scifi: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Sci-Fi"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  thriller: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Thriller"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
  tvshow: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"TV Show"}) {
     value{value}
  } 
}
```

then click on the big "play button" arrow in the center to execute the mutation

## 3. Retrieve genres with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 3a:** In GraphQL Playground, not changing playground tab (stay on the second: "graphql", yeah) run the following query to read the `value` column of all table rows:

```yaml
query getAllGenres {
    reference_list (value: {label:"genre"}) {
      values {
      	value
      }
    }
}
```

## 4. Create a table for movies

‚úÖ  **Step 4a:** Switch back to first playground tab ("graphql-schema"; the token header will be already set).

<details>
<summary>
Click for screenshot
</summary>

![image](images/graphql-back.png)

</details>

Use the following mutation to create a new table:

```yaml
mutation createMoviesTable {
  movies_by_genre: createTable(
    keyspaceName:"netflix",
    tableName:"movies_by_genre",
    ifNotExists: true,
    partitionKeys: [
      { name: "genre", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
    clusteringKeys: [ 
      { name: "year", type: {basic: INT}, order: "DESC" },
      { name: "title", type: {basic: TEXT}, order: "ASC" }
    ]
    values: [
      { name: "synopsis", type: {basic: TEXT} },
      { name: "duration", type: {basic: INT} },
      { name: "thumbnail", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
  )
}
```

## 5. Insert a few movies

‚úÖ  **Step 5a:** Go to playground tab "graphql" again. 

<details>
<summary>
Click for screenshot
</summary>

![image](images/graphql-playground-2.png)

</details>

Use the following mutation to populate the `movies_by_genre` table with four movies:

```yaml
mutation insertMovies {
  inception: insertmovies_by_genre(
    value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:2010,
      title:"Inception",
      synopsis:"Cobb steals information from his targets by entering their dreams.",
      duration:121,
      thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/RPa4UdO.mp4"}) {
        value{title}
    }
  
  prometheus: insertmovies_by_genre(value: { 
      genre:"Sci-Fi", 
      year:2012,
      title:"Prometheus",
      synopsis:"After a clue to mankind's origins is discovered, explorers are sent to the darkest corner of the universe.",
      duration:134,
      thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/L8k6Bau.mp4"}) {
        value{title}
    }
  
  	aliens: insertmovies_by_genre(value: {

## 6. Retrieve movies: Pagination

‚úÖ  **Step 6a:** In GraphQL Playground, not changing playground tab (stay on the second tab, "graphql", yeah) list values from the table with the following command:

```yaml
query getMovieAction {
  movies_by_genre (
      value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
      orderBy: [year_DESC]
  ) {
    values {
      year,
      title,
      duration,
      synopsis,
      thumbnail
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>
Show me!
</summary>

![image](images/graphql-playground-6.png)

</details>


‚úÖ **Step 6b: Enable pagination:** On a small dataset, you can retrieve all values in the table at once; but in general, for performance or network reasons, you'll need pagination. Run a similar query as before, but this time asking for a _page size of 2_:

```yaml
query getMovieActionPag1 {
    movies_by_genre (
        value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
        options: {pageSize: 2},
        orderBy: [year_DESC]
    ) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    pageState
    }
}
```

<details>
<summary>
Show me!
</summary>

![image](images/playground-2.png)

</details>


‚úÖ **Step 6c: Fetch the next page:**

Notice that `pageState` now is also returned. Use it to fetch the next 2 items (next page):
edit the next query to replace `YOUR_PAGE_STATE` with your own string value:

```yaml
query getMovieActionNextPage {
    movies_by_genre (
        value: {genre:"Sci-Fi"},
        options: {pageSize: 2, pageState: "YOUR_PAGE_STATE"},
        orderBy: [year_DESC]
    ) {
      values {
        year,
        title,
        duration,
        synopsis,
        thumbnail
      }
    pageState
    }
}
```
 
<details>
<summary>
Show me!
</summary>

![image](images/playground-3.png)

</details>


If you try to paste the _newly-obtained_ value for `pageState` and re-run the query, you get an empty list and a null `pageState` in return. D'oh! You had scrolled through all rows already:
_this is how pagination signals the end of the full results list._


‚úÖ **Step 6d: Bulk data load:** Load a large movie dataset in the database.
This command installs and properly launches the `DSBulk` tool ([docs](https://docs.datastax.com/en/dsbulk/docs/dsbulkAbout.html)).  Run this command in your gitpod terminal.

``` bash
astra db load workshops \
  -url data/movies.csv \
  -k netflix \
  -t movies_by_genre
```

</details>

> *Note*: we mock the trailers for these thousands of movies by using a handful
> of them over and over. Don't be surprised if you'll see the wrong trailers
> for your favorite movie!

That's it! All 6000+ movies are now loaded and ready to go!

# Part 3 - Connecting your Application

## 1. Serverless Functions

> _Note_: this section and the next one ("Fetching from the Front-End")
> are not steps to "perform", rather suggestions to dive in the app
> code and figure out how the various parts (React components, Netlify
> functions and finally the GraphQL server in Astra DB) fit together.
> **You can skip these and jump to the [next practical step](#6-install-the-netlify-cli)**

<details><summary>Show me this section</summary>

Take a look at `functions/getGenres.js`

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

exports.handler = async function (event) {

  const body = JSON.parse(event.body)
  const url = process.env.ASTRA_DB_GRAPHQL_URL
  const query = `
    query getAllGenres {
      reference_list (
        value: { label: "genre"},
        options: {
          pageSize: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageSize)},
          pageState: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageState)}
        }
      ) {
        values {
          value
        }
        pageState
      }
    }
  `

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-cassandra-token": process.env.ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query })
  })

  try {
    const responseBody = await response.json()
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(responseBody)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify(e)
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice the familiar GraphQL query "getAllGenres" you used previously in the playground.
It's been modified a bit to utilize pagination.
When building the GraphQL query, you pass the desired page size and state to the GraphQL API:

```javascript
options: {
  pageSize: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageSize)},
  pageState: ${JSON.stringify(body.pageState)}
}
```

You ask the API server to give us back the table column "value" (containing the genre name), but also the page state
for when you'll need the next page:

```javascript
{
  values {
    value
  }
  pageState
}
```

The serverless function `functions/getMovies.js` works in much the same way, but you provide the specific genre you want and the page size is hardcoded:

```javascript
query {
  movies_by_genre (
    value: { genre: ${JSON.stringify(genre)}},
    orderBy: [year_DESC],
    options: { pageSize: 6, pageState: ${JSON.stringify(pageState)} }
  ) {
    values {
      year,
      title,
      duration,
      synopsis,
      thumbnail
    }
    pageState
  }
}
```

</details>

## 2. Fetching from the Front-End

<details><summary>Show me this section</summary>

Take a look at how you fetch from these serverless functions from the front-end. Start in `src/App.js`

There is a fetch method defined, that will retrieve a page of genres by calling the `getGenres` serverless function.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  if (! isFetching)  {
    setIsFetching(true)
    const response = await fetch("/.netlify/functions/getGenres", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({pageState, pageSize}),
    })
    const responseBody = await response.json()
    setPageState(responseBody.data.reference_list.pageState)
    setGenres(gs => (gs || []).concat(responseBody.data.reference_list.values))
    setIsFetching(false)
  }
}
```

You pass in the current `pageState` and `pageSize` state variables and receive a response from the serverless function. You then set the `pageState` var to the new pagestate, and set the `genres` state variable to the received data. (Note that you are concatenating the new data to the var, since you want to keep all previously fetched data, not replace).

When rendering the page, you generate a `<Section>` component for each genre, plus a `<div>` at the bottom, which will detect a `mouseEnter` event and trigger the loading of a new pageful of genres:

```javascript
<>
  <NavBar />
  <HeroSection />
  {genres && (
    <div className="container">
      {Object.values(genres).map((genre) => (
        <Section key={genre.value} genre={genre.value} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )}
  <div
    className="page-end"
    onMouseEnter={() => {
      setRequestedPage( np => np + 1 )
    }}
  />
</>
```

The `<Section>` component works in the same way, but you will fully replace the data in the `movies` variable this time.

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/.netlify/functions/getMovies", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ genre: genre, pageState: pageState }),
  })
  const responseBody = await response.json()
  setMovies(responseBody.data.movies_by_genre.values)
  setPageState(responseBody.data.movies_by_genre.pageState)
}
```

Now that you know how the front-end works, launch the app!

## 3. Provide DB connection parameters

The "serverless functions" part of your app, in order to speak to
your DB through GraphQL, needs two important pieces of information:
the API endpoint and the token. You will now create a `.env` file which
defines them as environment variables.

The quickest way is to have `astra-cli` generate one for you:

```
astra db create-dotenv -k netflix workshops
```

## 4. Run the app in dev mode

‚úÖ **Start the app:** With the command

```
netlify dev
```

the application should automatically be displayed in GitPod's "simple browser".
Note that in this **dev-mode run** everything is local to your Gitpod instance:
_the "serverless functions", in particular, are actually running there,
alongside the rest of the application!_

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![run-in-preview-pane](images/preview.png)

</details>

You can copy the URL found in Gitpod's simple browser and open in a new tab
(of your real browser, that is) for a
better experience. But now it's time to move to the actual deploy phase.

## 5. Connect to your Netlify site

‚úÖ **Step 5a:** Stop the dev run with `Ctrl-C`.

‚úÖ **Step 5b:** Authenticate with Netlify: run

```
netlify login
```

then grab the URL printed on the console
(something like `https://app.netlify.com/authorize?response[...]`)
and manually **open it in a new tab** (Gitpod blocks it for security).
You will be asked to authorize "netlify-cli" to access your Netlify account
in the process.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify login](images/waiting_for_authorization-2.png)

</details>

Once you complete the login, you will see a console output like this:

![Netlify login](images/netlify-login-2.png)

‚úÖ **Step 5c:** Associate to your Netlify site: run

```
netlify link
```

and make sure you confirm the choice of associating to
"current git remote origin".

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify link](images/netlify-link-2.png)

</details>

## 6. Deploy in production!

‚úÖ **Step 6a:** Inject secrets to the Netlify site

```
netlify env:import .env
```

Now the (actually) serverless functions in Netlify have the connection
parameters they need.

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

_Note: If you generated the `.env` with
`astra-cli`, the actual output is much more verbose._

![image](images/netlify_env_import.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 6b:** Build the app

Run

```
netlify build
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify build](images/netlify-build.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 6c:** Deploy!

```
netlify deploy --prod
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify deploy in prod](images/netlify-deploy-prod-2.png)

</details>

‚úÖ **Step 6d:** Visit your site.

```
netlify open:site
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>

![Netlify Open site](images/netlify-open-site-2.png)

</details>

If needed, manually copy-paste your site URL in a new browser tab... and enjoy
your work!
